barcat concatenates text input similar to _cat_, but can visualize number values
by appending graphs and statistics.

# Installation

Copy or link the [barcat](https://github.com/shiar/barcat/raw/master/barcat)
script to the command `PATH`.
No dependencies besides _Perl_, so should run on most *nix environments.

# Usage

	barcat [OPTIONS] [FILES|NUMBERS]

Expected `barcat -h` gives an overview of accepted options.
`barcat --help` to Read The Friendly Manual, which includes many examples.
